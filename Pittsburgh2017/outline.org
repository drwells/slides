* things to discuss
  1. superconvergence overview: Laplace in 1D, CDR in 1D
  2. motivation: no-postprocessing (stability), intrinsic value (fluxes),
     multiphysics (compatibility BCs)
  3. goals: order n approximations to the function values -> order n first and
     second derivatives (like finite differences)
  4. a little on h and p finite elements (part of the background information:
     local p refinement != p-method): static p-refinement, global h-refinement
  5. other derivative methods (with citations)
  6. results for the laplace equation in 1D (zero error at knot -> arbitrary
     local order)
  7. Green's function result in 1D (for knot error near the boundary): O(h)
     derivatives on most of the domain -> we gain an order
  8. CDR boundary convergence result in 1D
  9. numerical results in 1D
  10. Extension to 2D: discuss just Laplace with Fourier transform in x for now
  11. normal p-enrichment algorithm: interpolation
  12. numerical example of a periodic domain (with breakdown if we include
      nonnormal p-refinement)
  13. numerical example of the circle: looks periodic near the boundary in the
      angular direction, exact description in polar coordinates
